<h1>Cooking Classes</h1>

<p>The Huffington Post loves us!</p>

<h3>Voted Best of the Best!</h3>

<p>Look what’s cooking in Haddonfield! Release your inner chef at our deliciously fun, technique based, hands-on cooking classes. We have classes for every level-come play with us In The Kitchen, and then sit down to dine. After all-it’s always about the food! In the Kitchen Cooking School is dedicated to teaching real kitchen skills, not just a menu. So even though most classes present a cuisine, it is the underlying technique that informs our classes. Once you have learned proper cooking methods, let your imagination and palate take you on a culinary journey!</p>

<h2>All Classes are hands-on.</h2>

<h2>Weeknight classes begin PROMPTLY at 6:30 PM.</h2>
