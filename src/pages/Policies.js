      In the Kitchen offers those who share our passion for cooking an
      opportunity to earn free classes! After assisting with three classes, you
      can attend an additional class of your choice for free. Be ready to do the
      following as a Sous Chef: Arrive at In the Kitchen Cooking School at least
      one hour before class to help with set-up and be prepared to stay about an
      hour and a half for clean up after class. Help with mise en place-light
      prep work, such as washing, chopping and setting up the stations. Round up
      ingredients for the chef during the class. E-mail us to get started
      earning classes today!
