  <p>  In the Kitchen is the perfect place for your private party. We will work with you to create the most memorable birthday, book club meeting, wedding shower, team building event, or just a fun night out with friends or family.
</p>
<br/>

<p>Our school has space for 28 guests for a “you be the chef” participation class, and can accommodate 30 guests for a demonstration class.</p>
<br/>
<p>All the guests will enjoy delicious food, and take home recipes for all the dishes prepared. Private classes are offered in the day or evening.</p>
