   <h1> Team Building</h1>
<p>Have you ever noticed how everyone always ends up in the kitchen at a party? At In the Kitchen Cooking School we use this gathering place as a tool to break down barriers and teach valuable skills through the common bond of food appreciation and cooking. Whether you decide upon an informal meeting or an “Iron Chef” competition, sharing time in the kitchen is a proven way to get the inspiration flowing and the interaction growing! And what better way to finish than by sharing a meal at the end of the day when the team has worked toward a common goal?</p>
<br/>
<p>Our school is the perfect place to bring your employees for an adventure that will enhance the positive dynamic of your organization and re-energize your corporate family. Meetings can be dull, but cooking is an excellent way to focus your group on working together and discovering their hidden talents. When people walk through our door, all titles lose their importance — what matters is what they bring to the table!</p>

<p>Chef-owner Kathy Gold left the world of investment banking and portfolio management for a soul-satisfying career in professional cooking. The skills she learned both as a chef and a corporate executive make Chef Gold uniquely qualified to develop the team building events that are fun, successful and meaningful.</p>
<br/>
<p>Unlike other cooking schools that only offer classes aimed at professional or home cooks, In the Kitchen creates customized programs and events for corporations and private companies. Our clients have found that our specialized approach is a fun and engaging way to build skills and relationships among their employees.</p>

<h3>See what some of them had to say after a recent event:</h3>

<span>“The entire experience from kitchen layout to final dish in the dishwasher was terrific! I felt like I was in Chef Kathy’s own kitchen making a meal together with her expert help and opinion. The staff is a wealth of knowledge and eager to help make your creations better than you had imagined. I learned alot and had fun while doing it. Thank you very much!!! ”</span>
<br/>
<span>“I thought the event was fantastic! It was a great team bonding experience. The facility is very nice, home-like, and relaxing. I appreciated the cooking tips as we were preparing as well. I don’t have time to attend cooking classes so having a team building and cooking class at same time was great (and you learn much more by doing than just watching someone demonstrate or tell you what to do). I would highly recommend for any group. Loved the dessert as well!”</span>
<br/>
