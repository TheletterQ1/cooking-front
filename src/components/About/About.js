    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>In the Kitchen Cooking School is the premier cooking school in the Delaware Valley. As featured in the Huffington Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, the Courier Post, Bucks County Times, and both New Jersey and NJ magazines, we offer deliciously creative and fun hands-on gourmet cooking classes, private parties, and team building events.
Classes at In the Kitchen get students involved in every aspect of the art of cooking — just as if they were professional chefs. Students learn to prepare mise en place, cook with and without recipes, orchestrate a full meal, and plate their culinary creations. At the end of the evening, students dine together on the delicious meals they have created.
Now in our new location on charming Mechanic Street in historic Haddonfield, New Jersey, In the Kitchen Cooking School is the perfect spot to release your inner chef! Join one of our classes, or gather your friends for a class designed just for you. Browse our retail area, stocked with some of our favorite ingredients and kitchen “toys”.
Chef Kathy invites you to come and play in the kitchen!
